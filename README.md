# Keystone Patch Panel

This 1U patch panel is designed for mounting keystone modules and is available in three widths: 10”, 19”, and half-rack (9.5”). Each width comes in two variants: a standard panel and one with added zip-tie posts for strain relief. Additionally, there are sparse versions where the keystone jacks are spaced further apart, allowing for larger (but fewer) modules.

This model is fully parametric and written in SwiftSCAD, allowing you to easily adjust parameters in the source code to fit your exact needs.

This model uses [SwiftSCAD](https://github.com/tomasf/SwiftSCAD) and [my Keystone library](https://github.com/tomasf/Keystone).
